In this document we essentially try to manage a CHNAGELOG as well as plan for 
managing high level tasks so we organize contributions.

The weekly update is due every Monday midnight EST.

Bullet form updates are requested so we can assess deliverables and reports given 
to outside collaborators. We docuent in reverse chronological order per week with the latest week 
first. We organize things per week by topic. Any update reportable to NIST is prefixed with (NIST), each contributor 
should have at least one report on weekly basis to NIST.

Keep in mind:

* What have I done?
* What have I not achieved?
* What would I like to achieve next time?
* What should be reported to external collaborators (NIST)?

## Monday 28th Feb, 2022

* Organizing collaborator support

  * Collaborators have set up environment 
    * (inmomplete reported) https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-run/issues/3

  * Overdue items
    * install software, learn github, earn multiprocessing, showcase FastAPI example
    * collaborate with catalog group on implementing start stoping services
    * work with gregor on command line to start sto services, you find out how to do, 
      gregor include in cms

  * (NIST) Meeting time does not match up with NIST, e.g. one day after NIST meeting 
    is not workable for updates. Updates must be done Monday midnight.

  * (NIST) Gregor's scheduling mishap prevented FAST API schema for file transfer and 
    high through put jobs
